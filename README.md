## 🔥 Code Philosophy

**Iteration over perfection.**

An aspiring MERN stack developer who learns by shipping, not just studying. I focus on building responsive interfaces, understanding backend systems, and improving through real-world mistakes. Progress is measured in clarity, not speed — and every commit moves the bar forward. 🟢💻
